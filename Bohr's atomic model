The Bohr model shows that the electrons in atoms are in orbits of differing energy around the nucleus (think of planets orbiting around the sun). Bohr used the term energy levels (or shells) to describe these orbits of differing energy.The energy level an electron normally occupies is called its ground state. The Bohr model can be summarized by the following four principles:

Electrons occupy only certain orbits around the nucleus. Those orbits are stable and are called "stationary" orbits.

Each orbit has an energy associated with it. The orbit nearest the nucleus has an energy of E1, the next orbit E2, etc.

Energy is absorbed when an electron jumps from a lower orbit to a higher one and energy is emitted when an electron falls from a higher orbit to a lower orbit.

The energy and frequency of light emitted or absorbed can be calculated by using the difference between the two orbital energies.
